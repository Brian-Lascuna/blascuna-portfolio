                <p>
                    My name is Brian Lascuna, I've been studying Computer Science for a few years and still have much to learn. I'm currently attending the UC Davis Coding Bootcamp
                    in hopes that I may kickstart myself into this industry and gain some valuable work experience wherever that may be. Although there is still a lot that I don't
                    know, I'm confident in my ability to learn things quickly and apply them accordingly. I'm also confident in my ability to communicate and work with others in a team
                    setting. The portfolio below contains projects that I have worked on over the course as well as some personal projects that I have worked on during my own time.
